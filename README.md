# Hi, I'm Winston ü©∑

Professionally, I've worked on:
- An order management system
- AWS's API Gateway
- A social media platform

I've also made a number of publicly available things:
- Making C# more functional with [PipeExtensions](https://github.com/winstonpuckett/WinstonPuckett.PipeExtensions) and [ResultExtensions](https://github.com/winstonpuckett/WinstonPuckett.ResultExtensions)
- A number of small programming languages like [ace](https://github.com/winstonpuckett/ace)
- An [11ty template](https://github.com/winstonpuckett/generator-eleventy-reasonable) with HTML/CSS/JS minification by default
- A [CLI testing application](https://github.com/winstonpuckett/lucifer) written in Rust

# What I'm working on right now üîß

I'm fascinated by the idea of a programming language which has no assignment operator. I'm currently, haphazardly, implementing a language so I can try this out. Feel free to take a look if you'd like: https://github.com/winstonpuckett/welang.

# I also have a blog ‚úèÔ∏è

I share what I've learned on [dev.to](https://dev.to/winstonpuckett).

# Isn't your name Bob? 

Yep, I go by my middle name for public dev work. Feel free to call me Bob or Winston.
